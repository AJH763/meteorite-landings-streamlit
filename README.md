- Data analysis with Pandas (pivot tables, sorting, filtering)
- Clean modular Python code following CS230 requirements

## 📊 Key Questions Answered
- How have meteorite landings changed over time?
- Which meteorites are the heaviest?
- Where do most meteorites land globally?
- How do fall types differ across decades?
